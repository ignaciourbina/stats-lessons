<h2 style="color: #047857;margin-top: 1.5em;">Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>Independence is a central concept in probability that tells us whether two events affect each other. This lesson explores the formal definition, intuitive meaning, and practical tests for determining independence between events. By the end, you'll understand why assuming independence without evidence can lead to flawed conclusions.</p>

<h3 style="color: #047857;margin-top: 1.5em;">Video Summary</h3>
<p>This video examines the concept of independent events in probability. It begins with the formal definition: two events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B). This is shown to be equivalent to saying P(A│B) = P(A) and P(B│A) = P(B), as long as both probabilities are nonzero. The video emphasizes the intuitive idea that learning one event occurred does not change the likelihood of the other. Several numerical examples illustrate how to test independence and how dependence affects outcomes. Visual tools such as Venn diagrams and bar plots help clarify the relationships. The lesson also covers how independence extends to complements and cautions against assuming independence without justification. A real-world example contrasts everyday uses of "independent" with its stricter mathematical meaning.</p>
