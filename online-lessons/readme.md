# Online Lessons

This directory hosts fully online lesson modules. It currently contains the Week 4 lessons in two formats. The original Google Apps Script (GAS) projects are kept alongside their static HTML/JS conversions created using the workflow described in `../migration_protocol/README.md`.

Subdirectories:

- `pol201_lesson_week4_part1/` – GAS version of Week&nbsp;4 Part&nbsp;1.
- `pol201_lesson_week4_part1_htmljs/` – static HTML/JS version.
- `pol201_lesson_week4_part2/` – GAS version of Part&nbsp;2.
