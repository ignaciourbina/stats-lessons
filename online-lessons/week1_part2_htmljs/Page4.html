<h3><i>Definition of Probability</i></h3>
<p>In this subsection, we'll briefly introduce the concept of probability from a frequentist perspective. We have previously explored probabilities in scenarios such as the Monty Hall Problem and in the context of the Presidential Election. Now, we will provide a more formal definition, setting the stage for a deeper exploration in Unit III of the syllabus.</p>
<p>From the frequentist viewpoint, <b>probability measures how likely an event is to occur based on its frequency over a very large number of trials</b>. For example, consider flipping a coin. A 'fair' coin is one where, if flipped a theoretically infinite number of times, you would expect it to land on heads about half of the time and on tails the other half. This idea leads us to expect that the probability of either outcome is one half.</p>
<p>Suppose one of your friends finds a coin on the street and wonders whether it is fair. <i>How could you determine if the coin is likely fair or not?</i></p>

<h3><i>The Coin Experiment.</i></h3>
<p>Imagine you decide on conducting an <i>experiment</i>. You decide to flip the coin 20 times, recording each outcome and counting how many times it lands on heads.</p>
<p>When flipping a coin, only two outcomes are possible: heads or tails. If the coin has been tampered with (perhaps due to an odd shape or a non-uniform distribution of weight), these modifications might influence its landings.</p>
<p>The true underlying probability of the coin landing on heads would ideally be estimated by observing its landings over a very large number of flips. However, for practical purposes, we start with just 20 flips to gather initial data.</p>
<p>After flipping the coin 20 times, suppose it lands on heads 14 times.</p>

<h3><i>Discussion.</i></h3>
<p>Results of the Experiment: {<i>Heads: 14 times, Tails: 6 times</i>}. This preliminary result suggests a 70% frequency of heads (14/20 = 0.7).</p>
<p>However, before drawing conclusions, we should consider whether 20 flips are sufficient to determine if the coin is fair. Because of the inherent variability and randomness in the experiment, even if the coin is truly a fair coin, short experiments can yield misleading results. Thus, to explore further, you might decide to increase the number of flips to 100 or even 1000 to see if the frequency of heads approaches 50%, which would strengthen the argument for the coin's fairness.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways </b></p>
<p><b>Trial</b>: In the most abstract sense, a 'trial' refers to a specific instance of observing or measuring an event, process, or activity.</p>
<p><b>Frequentist Probability</b>: This approach defines the probability of an outcome as its relative frequency over numerous trials.</p>
<p><b>Experiment Size and Bias:</b> In experiments with a small number of trials, like our 20 coin flips, the estimated probability can significantly differ from the true probability. This difference highlights the importance of large sample sizes in obtaining more accurate probability estimates. But note that it is also important that our experiment is not biased, ensuring that each trial is a true random draw and represents the underlying phenomenon accurately.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>True or False:</strong> <em>"Under the frequentist definition of probability, the chance of heads is the long-run relative frequencyâ€”so a small experiment of just 20 flips can yield a misleading 70% heads, whereas increasing to 100 or 1000 flips should make the observed head frequency converge toward the true 50% value for a fair coin."</em></span></p>
