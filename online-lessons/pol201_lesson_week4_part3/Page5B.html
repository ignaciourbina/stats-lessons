  <h1>Hypothesis Tests: Rejection Region and P-Value Approach</h1>
  <p><em>Please carefully watch the following videos. </em></p>

  <h3><i>For the next two videos, pay attention to the following ideas:</i></h3>
  <ul>
      <li>1) What is the rejection (critical) region? What is the non-rejection region?</li>
      <li>2) What is the conceptual difference between the rejection (critical) region and the non-rejection region?</li>
      <li>3) What does it mean, intuitively, that for the test we assume the test statistic distribution to follow under the null hypothesis?</li>
      <li>4) Why does a value of the test statistic that falls very far away from the null hypothesis (inside the rejection region), looking at its position regarding the test statistic distribution, suggest evidence against the null hypothesis? </li>
      <li>5) Why does a smaller p-value suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis? </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that in the following videos, the tests are about the population mean, and assuming a normally distributed population. For quiz 4, we will only cover hypothesis tests of the proportion. Yet, the main ideas and intuitions are the same for both kinds of hypothesis tests. So, as you watch these videos, please <strong>focus on understanding the graphs, intuition, and the concepts</strong>.<p>
