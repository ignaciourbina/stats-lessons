            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When we compare two groups to see if they differ in some specific characteristic, we often look at proportions. For instance, we might compare the percentage of voters in two regions who support a particular policy or the proportion of customers in different age groups who prefer a new product.</p>

            <h2>Why Compare Proportions?</h2>
            <p>Comparing proportions helps us understand if these differences are just due to random chance or if they reflect a real underlying trend. This is especially important in fields like medicine, marketing, and public policy, where making decisions based on these comparisons can have significant implications.</p>

            <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
            <p>Consider a health study comparing the effectiveness of two treatments across different patient groups or a market research survey analyzing customer satisfaction levels in different demographics. By comparing proportions, we can draw meaningful conclusions that help guide future actions and strategies.</p>

    <p>To solve this question we need to follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculate the proportions of success for each group.</li>
        <li>Compute the pooled proportion since we're testing for equality between two proportions. In other words, since the null assumes equality of proportions we can estimate the SE using the pooled proportion.</li>
        <li>Using the pooled proportion, calculate the standard error of the difference in proportions.</li>
        <li>Compute the test statistic using the standard error and the difference in observed proportions.</li>
        <li>Find the 𝑝-value to determine the significance of our results. Recall, for a two-tailed Z-test, we find the p-value by computing: 2*(1 - Pr(Z ≤ |Z statistic|). Note that some references call the Z statistic calculated with the sample data the ""Z observed."" or ""Z obs.""</li>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Chi-Square Test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a sample, or to test the distribution of a single categorical variable. These variables can involve categories like gender, race, or other non-numerical classifications.</p>

            <h2>Why Use Chi-Square Test?</h2>
            <p>This test compares the observed frequencies of the categories of one variable (or the single variable itself for single variable analysis) for the different groups or categories of another variable, with what we would expect if there were no association between the variables or the single variable was distributed equally. Thus, it helps determine whether the differences between the observed and expected frequencies are statistically significant.</p>

            <h2>Where Can We Apply Chi-Square Tests?</h2>
            <p>Chi-Square tests can be applied in different fields for various purposes. For instance, in market research, it can be used to compare the preferences of different groups of consumers. It can also be used to check whether the distribution of political affiliations differs by age group. Notably, it's useful when testing a hypothesis about the distribution of a single categorical variable, like analyzing whether the number of people who prefer different types of social media are distributed equally across the options.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of Dice Fairness</h3>
    <p>The following results are based on a Chi-square test conducted to determine if a six-sided dice is fair based on 120 rolls.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Solve the Question:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculate the expected frequencies assuming the dice is fair (each face should appear 20 times).</li>
        <li>Use the observed frequencies of each face from the game.</li>
        <li>Compute the Chi-square statistic to compare observed and expected frequencies. Note that we have 6 frequency cells, so we should use (6 - 1) = 5 degrees of freedom for the Chi-sq distribution.</li>
        <li>Calculate the p-value to assess the significance of the results. In this case, p-value = Pr( X ≥ {Chi.sq Statistic} ).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Results:</h3>

    <p>Based on the analysis, the p-value of 0.715 is greater than the typical alpha level of 0.05, suggesting no statistically significant evidence to indicate the dice is biased.</p>
    <p>The formula for the Chi-square statistic is:</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Understanding population means through samples is a cornerstone of statistical analysis. We often estimate these means to make decisions or predict future trends. This can involve a single group or comparing two distinct groups.</p>

            <h2>Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p>Constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests are fundamental methods for making inferences about population means. These tools help us understand the range within which the true mean likely falls or whether observed differences in means are statistically significant.</p>

            <h2>Why Use the t-Distribution?</h2>
            <p>When dealing with small sample sizes from a population that is normally distributed, the t-distribution becomes crucial. Unlike the z-distribution, which is used for larger samples, the t-distribution accounts for the increased variability in estimates that arises from smaller samples.</p>

            <h2>One Mean vs. Difference Between Two Means</h2>
            <p>For a single mean, we estimate the mean of a population based on sample data. For two means, we compare them to ascertain differences. This can apply to any field, from measuring educational achievements across different schools to analyzing clinical outcomes between two treatment groups.</p>

            <p>In all these cases, if the sample size is small and the population is assumed to be normal, the t-distribution provides a more appropriate model for the analysis, ensuring that our conclusions are more reliable.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When conducting statistical inference for the sample mean, we often face a choice between using the t-distribution and the z-distribution. This decision hinges on several key factors, which we will explore in this discussion.</p>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p><strong>Point 1:</strong> For doing inference for the sample mean, we almost never know the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)).</p>
            <p><strong>Point 2:</strong> The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies for a large sample size (N), regardless of: 
                <ul>
                    <li>The population distribution of the random variable</li>
                    <li>Whether we know the variance of the population distribution</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Point 3:</strong> As described in Professor Balka’s videos (JBStatistics), if our <em>sample is small and the underlying population follows a normal distribution</em>, then in the Z transformation we <strong>must</strong> replace \(\sigma\) with the sample variance (\(s\)), and we use the t-distribution, which depends on the degrees of freedom,  \( df \text{ = } N \text{ - } 1  \). Hence, in this situation, when doing inference of one population mean we use the T-statistic equal to  \( T \text{ = } \frac{\bar{X}\text{ - }\mu_0}{s\text{/}\sqrt{N}}   \). </p>
            <p><strong>Point 4:</strong> But to use the t-distribution, the key assumption is that the underlying population is normal. In many cases, we won't be able to assume this is true.</p>
            <p><strong>Main idea:</strong> This implies that in small samples (where the CLT does not apply), if we are sure the underlying population is not normal, then we lack a way to do inference using conventional tools generally taught at the introductory statistics level. However, most pollsters and political science researchers use relatively large samples. In practice, most researchers use samples of at least 400 cases, well above the \(n \text{ > } 30\) threshold. So, for political science research, we almost always can use the z-distribution by calling upon the CLT.</p>
            <p><strong>Second takeaway:</strong> Professor Balka is correct that if the underlying population can surely be assumed to be normal (for example, we know that height and test scores are mostly normal), then the t-distribution will always be correct, as we don't need to rely on the CLT.</p>
            <p><strong>Third takeaway:</strong> When is my sample size large? This is very subjective. For example, for proportions, the book says that the CLT applies when \(p \text{ $\cdot$ } n \text{ > } 10\) and  \(\text{(}1 \text{ - } p\text{)} \text{ $\cdot$ } n \text{ > } 10\) . Others suggest a threshold of 5 for both the positive and negative cases. In truth, unless there is a very rigorous study providing justification, a sample of 50 or 100 might not be large enough to use the CLT depending on the random process we are modeling. Yet, again, to use the t-distribution, we have to assume the underlying random variable, \(X\), follows a normal distribution. <strong> This is why, if the sample is small, when doing inference for the population mean, we always use the T distribution and the T statistic. </strong>  </p>
		<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> When we have a small sample size and want to minimize the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) when it is actually true (a Type I error), it's more prudent to assume that the underlying population follows a normal distribution. This approach leads us to use the T-test for hypothesis testing in small samples.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When performing statistical analysis, we often compare two groups to understand their differences. However, in some scenarios, these groups are not independent and contain matched pairs of observations. Such pairs may arise due to repeated measures on the same subject or matched subjects based on certain characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Independence Assumption</h2>
            <p>A key assumption in many statistical tests is that of independence, i.e., the observation in one group does not influence the observation in the other. Matched samples violate this assumption because the same person or unit of observation is present in both groups. For example, in a medical trial studying the effects of a drug, each patient may be assessed before and after treatment. The before and after measurements are not independent since they relate to the same individual.</p>

            <h2>Working with Matched Samples</h2>
            <p>To address this issue, we perform a different type of analysis. Instead of comparing two sets of measurements directly, we compute the difference between each pair of matched observations. The resulting set of differences can then be analyzed using statistical inference methods. This approach re-establishes the independence between observations, enabling us to proceed with the common statistical tests.</p>

            <h2>Steps for Conducting Matched Sample Inference</h2>
            <p>Conducting a matched sample inference involves many of the same steps as the traditional hypothesis test or confidence interval for independent samples. However, the calculations focus on the differences between pairs instead of raw data. Below is a step-by-step guide:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Define the Population of Differences</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use your pairs of observations to define the population of differences. This population consists of the difference between the pairs for all possible matched pairs in the whole population.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: State Hypotheses or Confidence Level</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>State the null and alternative hypotheses for hypothesis testing, or define the desired confidence level for a confidence interval. These statements concern the mean of the population of differences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Compute Sample Statistics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Compute the differences between the matched pairs. Use these differences to calculate the sample mean difference and sample standard deviation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Conduct the Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform a hypothesis test using the sample statistics and the relevant t-distribution. Calculate the test statistic and p-value. Alternatively, form a confidence interval using the same sample statistics and t-distribution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Make the Statistical Decision</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a hypothesis test, reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level. For a confidence interval, interpret the interval in the context of the problem. Note that if zero is not in the interval, this is equivalent to rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference in a two-tailed test at the corresponding significance level.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: Interpret the Result</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending upon your statistical decision, provide a meaningful interpretation in the context of the problem. Discuss the implications of your findings.</li>

        <h1>Understanding the Difference of Two Means</h1>
    </div>
</header>

<div class=""container main"">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In many practical scenarios, we are interested in comparing the average or mean values of a particular characteristic from two different groups or populations. This could be, for example, the average time spent on a website by visitors from two different countries, or the average yield of two different varieties of wheat.</p>

    <h2>Why Compare Means?</h2>
    <p>Comparing means enables us to identify significant differences between groups. Understanding these differences helps us make informed decisions and predict future trends. This can be particularly beneficial in fields like economics, medicine, agriculture, and social sciences, where understanding the mean differences can lead to more effective policies, enhanced product yields, and better health outcomes.</p>
    
    <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
    <p>Consider a business owner who wants to evaluate the average sales in two different stores, or a researcher who is comparing the average blood pressure levels in two groups following different diets. The conclusions drawn from comparing means can consequently assist in planning strategic actions and remedial measures if necessary.</p>
