<b>Yes, that is correct!</b><br>Dr. Stevens should use the T-test for the following reasons:
<ul>
	<li>The sample size is small (n = 12), which increases the uncertainty in estimating the population parameters.</li>
	<li>The T-distribution, with its heavier tails, is more appropriate for small sample sizes as it provides more conservative P-values, reducing the risk of Type I errors (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true).</li>
</ul>
