# Interactive Problem Sets

This folder collects small web-based problem sets. Each subfolder contains the files needed to run the exercises directly in a browser.

- **probability/** – a self-contained HTML problem set on basic probability. `index.html` is the entry page and uses Tailwind for layout and MathJax for formulas.
- **inference-one-proportion/** – currently just a placeholder for a future exercise.
- **style.css** – simple styling used by the exercises.

These pages are meant to be static resources that can be uploaded to an LMS.
