# Week 4 Lesson Part 1 (GAS version)

Original Google Apps Script project used to deliver the first portion of the Week 4 lesson. The folder contains `Index.html`, several page fragments (`Page1.html`â€“`Page7.html`), a `Questions.html` file, and `Code.js` which implements the server side logic for checking answers. The `appsscript.json` file stores project configuration.
