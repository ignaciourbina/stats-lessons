# Stats Lessons Repository

This repository stores materials for the POL201 statistics course. The content is organized by type so that lessons, slides and supporting resources can be uploaded to a learning management system.

## Folder Overview

- **lecture-slides/** – PDF slide decks for each lecture.
- **migration_protocol/** – documentation describing how Google Apps Script lessons were migrated to static HTML/JS along with a database of videos and questions.
- **online-lessons/** – reserved for future fully online lessons (currently empty).
- **pol201_lesson_week4_part1**, **part2**, **part3** – original Google Apps Script projects for Week 4, split into three parts.
- **pol201_lesson_week4_part1_htmljs**, **part2_htmljs**, **part3_htmljs** – HTML/JavaScript versions of the same lessons for embedding into Brightspace.
- **weekly-quizzes/** – placeholder for weekly quiz files.
