  <h1>Hypothesis Tests: Rejection Region and P-Value Approach</h1>
  <p><em>Please read closely the following.</em></p>

  <h3><i>Here are the main takeaways from the two previous videos:</i></h3>
  <ul>
      <li>1) What is the rejection (critical) region? What is the non-rejection region? <br>
      <strong>Brief answer: </strong> <em>The rejection region is the set of test statistic values for which we will reject the null hypothesis. The non-rejection region is where we do not reject the null hypothesis (generally the are under 1-alpha).</em></li>
      <li>2) What is the conceptual difference between the rejection (critical) region and the non-rejection region? <br>
      <strong>Brief answer: </strong> <em>The rejection region contains values of the test statistic that are very unlikely under the null hypothesis, suggesting that we should reject the null hypothesis if our test statistic falls there. The non-rejection region includes values of the test statistic that are more likely under the null hypothesis.</em></li>
      <li>3) What does it mean, intuitively, that for the test we assume the test statistic distribution to follow under the null hypothesis? <br>
      <strong>Brief answer: </strong> <em>It means that we assume our data behaves as if the null hypothesis is true and base our expectations and calculations on that assumption.</em></li>
      <li>4) Why does a value of the test statistic that falls very far away from the null hypothesis (inside the rejection region), looking at its position regarding the test statistic distribution, suggest evidence against the null hypothesis? <br>
      <strong>Brief answer: </strong> <em>Because under the null hypothesis, the probability of obtaining such extreme values is very low, indicating that something other than the null hypothesis might be true.</em></li>
      <li>5) Why does a smaller p-value suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis? <br>
      <strong>Brief answer: </strong> <em>The p-value measures the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means that the observed data would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis, providing stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.</em></li>
  </ul>
