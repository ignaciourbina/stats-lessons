  <h1>Question: Test Your Knowledge!</h1>
  <p><em>To solve this question consider the 5 steps in hypothesis testing. </em></p>
  <p> Steps Involved in Carrying Out the Test:<br>
      1. State the null and alternative hypotheses:<br>
      2. Calculate the sample proportion:<br>
      3. Compute the standard error of the proportion assuming the null hypothesis.<br>
      4. Calculate the test statistic (Z)<br>
      5. Determine the critical value for a one-sided test at the 99% confidence level<br>
      6. Compare the test statistic to the critical value:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Please consider the following question. </strong></p>

  <p>A recent poll suggests that 55% of voters support Candidate A in an upcoming election. A political analyst believes that the true support for Candidate A is actually higher than 55%. To test this claim, a sample of 500 voters is surveyed, and 310 of them express support for Candidate A. The test is conducted at the 99% confidence level.</p>

    <div class="question">
    <p><b>1. Carry out the test following the 6 steps. What is the correct conclusion from the test?</b></p>
    <form id="formQ5">
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="A">A) The test statistic is less than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that the true support for Candidate A is higher than 55%.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="B">B) The test statistic is greater than the critical value, so we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is enough evidence to conclude that the true support for Candidate A is higher than 55%.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="C">C) The test statistic is greater than the critical value, so we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is enough evidence to conclude that the true support for Candidate A is higher than 55%.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="D">D) The test statistic is equal to the critical value, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that the true support for Candidate A is higher than 55%.</label>
