  <h1>Question: Test Your Knowledge!</h1>
  <p><em>Please consider the following question. </em></p>

  <p>A researcher claims that a new drug is effective in curing a particular disease. Historically, the cure rate for the disease without any treatment is 30%. A clinical trial with 150 patients who received the new drug showed that 55 of them were cured. A hypothesis test is conducted at the 95% confidence level and is a two-tailed test.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>1. What is the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1) for this test?</b></p>
    <form id="formQ2">
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="A">A) H0: The cure rate with the new drug is equal to 30%.<br>H1: The cure rate with the new drug is greater than 30%.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="B">B) H0: The cure rate with the new drug is equal to 30%.<br>H1: The cure rate with the new drug is less than 30%.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="C">C) H0: The cure rate with the new drug is equal to 30%.<br>H1: The cure rate with the new drug is different from 30%.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="D">D) H0: The cure rate with the new drug is less than 30%.<br>H1: The cure rate with the new drug is equal to 30%.</label>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>3. Based on the comparison of the test statistic and the critical value, what conclusion should be drawn about the effectiveness of the new drug?</b></p>
    <form id="formQ4">
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="A">A) The test statistic is equal to the critical value, so we reject the null hypothesis. This means the new drug is exactly as effective as the historical cure rate.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="B">B) The test statistic is less than the critical value, so we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is enough evidence to conclude that the new drug is more effective than the historical cure rate.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="C">C) The test statistic is greater than the critical value, so we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is enough evidence to conclude that the new drug is more effective than the historical cure rate.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="selectedAns" value="D">D) The test statistic is less than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that the new drug is more effective than the historical cure rate.</label>
