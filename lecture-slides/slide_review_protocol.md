# Slide Review Protocol

This protocol describes the recommended workflow for documenting the key ideas in each lecture slide deck. Follow these steps whenever preparing notes from the provided PDF files.

## 1. Preparation
1. Navigate to the `lecture-slides` directory and identify the PDF file to review.
2. Create a working notes file (e.g., `W1_Lecture1_notes.md`) in the same folder or a subfolder for notes.
3. Open the PDF in a reader that allows navigation by slide number.

## 2. Document Structure
For each slide deck, your notes should include:
- **File name and lecture title.** Record the exact file name for reference.
- **Week/topic overview.** Summarize the main focus of the lecture.
- A table with the following columns for each slide:
  - *Slide number*
  - *Concepts covered*
  - *Definitions*
  - *Formulas*
  - *Procedures or examples*

## 3. Reviewing Slides
1. Go through the slides sequentially.
2. For every slide, list the important terms, definitions, formulas, and any procedural steps (e.g., example problems, derivations).
3. If a slide references previous material, crossâ€‘link to the appropriate lecture or slide.
4. Keep explanations concise but complete so another student could follow without the original PDF.

## 4. Checking for Completeness
- Verify that every slide has an entry in your notes table.
- Ensure definitions are stated precisely as in the slides or paraphrased accurately.
- Include formulas using clear mathematical notation. For complex formulas, provide a short description of each symbol.
- When procedures span multiple slides (e.g., hypothesis testing steps), summarize the flow in order.

## 5. Finalizing Notes
1. Review your notes to confirm that concepts, definitions, formulas, and procedures are all captured.
2. Save the notes file in Markdown format.
3. Update `readme.txt` or another index file if a new notes document is added.

By following this protocol for each lecture slide deck, you'll create a detailed accounting of the course content that is easy to reference during study or future course updates.
