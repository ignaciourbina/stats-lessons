Lecture Slides
==============

PDF slide decks used in the POL201 course. The files are organized by week and lecture number. They cover topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, sampling distributions, and inference for proportions and means.  Each PDF can be viewed independently and is ready for upload to the course LMS.

Additional Markdown notes summarizing each slide deck are stored in the `notes` subfolder. New notes can be added following `slide_review_protocol.md`.
