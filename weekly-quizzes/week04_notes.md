Week 4 quiz covers material from Lecture 7 and Lecture 8 slide decks on estimators, sampling distributions, and inference for one proportion.

References:
- Lecture 8 slides 4--40 for definitions of sample proportion, sampling distribution, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
- Lecture 7 slides 28--34 for background on the Central Limit Theorem.

The quiz now contains ten conceptual and ten calculation questions in multiple choice format. Most examples are framed around polling and policy studies to connect the statistical methods to social science applications.
