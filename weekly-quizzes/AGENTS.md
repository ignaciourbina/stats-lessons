# AGENTS.md â€“ weekly-quizzes

## Mission
Store Brightspace-ready quiz CSV files for each week.

## Key References
- `readme.md` summarises the folder purpose.
- Use the quiz builder instructions in `instructions/agents/AGENTS.md` and the API in `scripts/module_quiz_builder_to_csv.py` when creating new quizzes.
- Follow `question_set_protocol.md` to build the LaTeX question set for each week before converting to CSV.

## Common Tasks
- Add new CSV files named by week (e.g., `week01_quiz.csv`).
- Use `question_log.md` to note where each quiz question originated and document any manual edits.
