  \item $p$ close to $0.5$
  \item $n\ge30$ regardless of $p$
  \end{enumerate}
\item A city survey records $245$ supporters of a bus lane out of $500$ residents. What are $\hat{p}$ and its estimated standard error?
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
  \item $\hat{p}=0.49$,\quad SE $\approx0.022$
  \item $\hat{p}=0.51$,\quad SE $\approx0.022$

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]

  \item None, the CLT always holds
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
  \item The difference may lack practical importance despite being statistically significant
  \item Statistical significance guarantees a meaningful real-world effect
  \item The result must be due to a sampling error
  \item Larger sample sizes always make results more practical

  \item About $11$
  \item About $22$
  \item About $7$

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
  \item It specifies a benchmark proportion to compare against
  \item It describes the sampling method used
  \item It guarantees the alternative hypothesis is false
  \item It adjusts the confidence level
