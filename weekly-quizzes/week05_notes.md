Week 5 quiz draws on Lectures 10, 11 and 12 covering sampling distributions for estimators, large-sample inference for means and small-sample t procedures.

References:
- Lecture 10 slides 2--8 for properties of the sample mean and introduction to comparing two means.
- Lecture 11 slides 5--16 for confidence intervals, standard error calculations and hypothesis testing steps.
- Lecture 12 slides 3--31 for t-distribution methods, paired-sample analysis and the Welch approach.

The set contains fifteen multiple choice questions that mix conceptual definitions with short calculations. Examples mirror the slide examples about commute times, voter-ID effects and civics quiz scores.
